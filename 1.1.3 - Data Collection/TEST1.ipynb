Run this notebook to convert images to a single row of raw, normalized values (between 0 and 1) and upload them to Edge Impulse as raw samples. Note that pixel values will be normalized to be between 0 and 1.

Create a folder named "dataset" in the /content directory and upload your images there. The images should be divided into their respective classes, where each class has its own folder with the name of the class. For example:

<pre>
/content
    |- dataset
        |- background
        |- capacitor
        |- diode
        |- led
        |- resistor
</pre>
